# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO - MARK HORSFALL

## PURPOSE

This file has been created to showcase the coding that I have done across a number of projects. It is intended that it will be maintained and updated as my portfolio deepens over time.

## TECHNOLOGIES EMPLOYED

This project was built using HTML and CSS tools I have learned in the first two weeks of my full stack developer boot camp. No JS has been employed at this time but it will be in the future.

## FEEDBACK ENCOURAGED

Please drop me a line at horsfalm@gmail.com with any comments, feedback or advice!

Thank you!
